building an AR ARt Gallery using A-Frame and WebXR 


This repository follows the steps to build an A-Frame AR Art Gallery.  It is expended into WebXR using https://github.com/dougsillars/ar-with-webxr


1. We begin with the A-Frame Hellow World (aframeHW.html) as an introduction to A-Frame.

2. Next, We build a 4m x4m room with 4 walls and a ceiling (aframeroom.html) as the beginning of a VR art gallery.  But there is no art!

3.  aframeroomart.html adds one piece of art, but the room feels really empty.

4.  aframeroomart2.html adds more art to 3 walls (and close to realistic size), and adds a 3D model of David behind the viewer.

5. But this is all VR.  Can we do AR with A-Frame?  Yes,  hiro.html is an intro.

6. ARt.html uses 4 patters that can be hug on the real wall for AR.js to add AR art over the top.
